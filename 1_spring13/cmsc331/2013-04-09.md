Function Calls and data
=======================

Seeming problem of function calls.

When lisp starts: 

    > 

Then you type in an expression to evaluate. 

    > (F A B) 

is the list with 3 things. Then you can tell lisp to evaluate it using the
evaluation rules. 

Simple evaluation rules 
-----------------------
* Numbers evaluate to themselves. 
* `#t` and `#f` evaluate to themselves. 
* Any other atoms (e.g., `foo`) represents variables and evaluates to their
  values. 
* a list of n elements represents a function call: `(add1 a)`
* Evaluate each of the n elements... 
* Apply function to arguments and return value. 

Functions are atoms that get looked up in the symbol table. This is
fundamentally different than most other languages: Java, C, etc. 

There are functions that violate these rules, such as `define`. (First element
doesn't get evaluated.) Another is `quote` and `if`. 

Symbols
=======

Symbols are atomic names and are used as names of variables and
procedures. Scheme does not allow a symbol to be bound to a procedure and a
function. Common lisp does.
