* MUMPS
* Visual Basic
* Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) 
* SQL 

MUMPS
-----
* Massachusetts general hospital utility multiprogramming system
* 9/77 became ANSI standard
* Database Language
* Designed in 1966 for Health care industry.
* Still used today by hospitals, banks, & credit unions. 

Issues with limit of size in production. (Limited to 1gb...) 

What is software testing
========================

* A process used to manipulate software to ensure it meets requirements
* Testing processes are not always objective. 

> Which way should buttons go in dialog boxes? (User Experience or UX Testing) 

Importance of testing
=====================
* Amazon AWS takes down Netflix on Christmas Eve 2012.  A programmer at amazon
  decided to check in a piece of code without testing. >.< 
* July 1991 - Telephone services shut down in several cities affecting 12 M 
  people. Software not tested thoroughly enough. 
* 1985-1987 deaths of cancer patients due to radiation OD. Program not tested
  thoroughly enough, values didn't change. 
* Northeast blackout of 2003. Caused by software bug of alarm system

Integrity
=========
Another reason to test code. 

May 2010: Sacramento Credit Union instructions to customers telling them not to 
use keywords such ad `update`, `drop` etc.

Types of software testing
=========================

* Unit testing is the one we'll probably use. 
* Regression testing is used a lot. 
* Load testing - popular
* Integration Testing - popular
* Smoke Testing - Take a new build and run it through paces for an hour. 
* Boundary Value Testing - testing the limits on a system. 
* Functional Testing - done by QA a lot
* Sanity testing. `//void test() { return false; }` 
* Free-fall - give it to customer and let them run it through their paces. 

Many, many, many, more. 

Who tests? 
========== 
* Not just testers. 
* Developers
* Documentation experts
* User Experience experts
* Product Managers
* Any other stakeholders. 
* **AUTOMATION IS KING**

Challenges to testing
=====================
* Mutlipe OS's
* Multiple Browsers (Android, iPad, kindle) 
* Multiple terminals/hardware
* Multiple databases
* Multiple security plugins. 
* Multiple hardware configurations. 

Operating Systems:
==================

UX: 

* CentoOS
* Red Hat
* HPUX
* Ubuntu (Xubuntu) 
* Google Chrome OS
* OS X 

Windows: 

* Server 2003, 2008 32 and 64 bit
* XP 
* Vista, 7, 8 

WTF with Autohiding taskbars and IE7. 

Databases
=========
* MS Access 
* dBase
* Oracle
* MongoDB
* IBM DB2
* Microsoft SQL Server
* SQLite
* MySQL

Bugs
====
* We Share the Pain Program (Microsoft WSYP) 
* Grace Hopper is creditied with "Debugging". 
* Moth found in a relay switch 

Friend or foe?
==============
* Consider a tester your best friend
* Don't take to hear the bugs they find
* They share your goals. 

Common testing practices: 
=========================
* Think outside the box
* test with large values
* Test wtih different data
* Test with null data
* Have another developer test your code
* CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete
* Don't be afraid to break things 
* Use all sorts of symbols: & ^ $ |, space, etc. 

Good vs. Bad Error Messages: Avoid Vauge language: "Something went wrong."
