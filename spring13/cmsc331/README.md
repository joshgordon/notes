CMSC 331
========

This was probably my favorite class of the Spring 2013. It went over principles
of many different programming languages - not how to program in them, but
defining grammars and stuff like that.  

Also, towards the end it covered
[Scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language\)) and
[PERL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl).
