Using global for searching: does more than just the first occurrence. 

Perl as a programming language
==============================

    0.00 is the same as 0 which is the same as "0". so 0.00 is false. 
    "0.00" != "0", so "0.00" is true. 
    BUT. "0.00" + 0 is true. (== 0.00)

While vs. Do while...
	
Doesn't necessairly do what one would expect.	

Barewords. Quotation marks are optional? 

    print STDOUT hello, ' ', world, "\n"; 

outputs `hello world` STDOUT is necessary, otherwise print looks in hello
for a filehandle. 

PGA (Perl Golf Apocalypse)
--------------------------
Trying to see how obscure perl code can be. 

Prolog
======
Rule based programming, logic programming, and prolog.

Prolog = Programming and logic. Expressing a program as a set of rules, not
as a set of instructions. 

CFGs can be thought of as a rule based language. 

* Logic programming used a lot in AI systems. Also very popular with database
  people. 

* Uses language of formal logic. Uses the notion of an automatic theorem 
  prover as an interpreter. 

* Proof must be a constructive one so that more than a true/false answer
  can be obtained. 

* Completly nonprocedural.
