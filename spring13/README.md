In the Spring semester of 2013, I took 4 classes, but only 2 currently have
notes posted here. 

The 4 classes I took were: 

* CMSC 331 (Principles of Programming languages) 
* CMSC 345 (Software Design & Development) 
* HIST 102 (Post civil-war) 
* MATH 251 (Calc III) 

You will notice an absence of a lot of notes - because a lot of my notes
through the first half of the semester were taken on actual paper! From
here on out, though, I feel as though I'll just do them here.
